This zip file contains Java classes to allow you to access the Virgin Money Giving API.

The contents of this zip are

- The SDK jar file itself

- Additional libraries that it requires (you may already have these, in which case you can ignore our supplied ones)

- Javadoc - this is deliberately lightweight as the main API documentation can be viewed via http://developer.virginmoneygiving.com

- Some sample code which excutes a couple of basic API calls.

BEFORE YOU START

You will need to obtain an API Key for the Virgin Money Giving Connect API  via http://developer.virginmoneygiving.com

NOTES

This SDK was developed under Java 6. For Java 7 you will need additional dependencies.
